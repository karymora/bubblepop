## About Bubble Pop ##
Bubble pop consists in guiding your main character trough the sea, helping it collect as many prices as you can
before a bubble hits you, ending the game.

 Made in Javascript and HTML5 with a little help from CSS


## How to play ##
Left, right and top arrows help you swim in the boardgame. You can't control going down. If yo are not pushing 
the right keys , our character will sink. If you let it go to the bottom, you'll lose even if no bubble hits
you. Th only way you can stay on top without pushing keys is by stepping in one of the platforms created at 
random. Just watch out! platforms also move and dissapear at their will. 

## Enjoy! ##
